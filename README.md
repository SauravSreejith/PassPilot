### Project Description
PassPilot is an AI-assisted exam survival guide tailored for KTU students, designed to optimize exam preparation under time constraints. The system uses historical PYQ data, topic frequency analysis to generate personalized minimum-effort study plans aimed at achieving the pass mark threshold (typically 40/100). At its core, PassPilot implements algorithms that score topics based on frequency, difficulty, and expected mark yield. The platform supports a dual-track mode â€” Survival Track for minimum viable prep and Excellence Track for extended study paths. It features a crisis-mode engine for last-minute planning, an effort-to-marks estimator. Built with a modular architecture, PassPilot offers a clean, efficient interface with real-time pass probability estimation and personalized topic recommendations.
